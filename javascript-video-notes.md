Beginning the Beginner's series [1 of 51]
Introduction to the people who contributed to the video.We will be guide if any queries occured to us.Previous knowledge of the programming languages.

What is JavaScript [2 of 51]
The video summaries the what is Javascript,uses and its popularity.Javascript does not need to be complied. According to Stackoverflow Survey 2019 javascript is the most used language in the world.

3. Running JavaScript: browser or server [3 of 51]

Discusses the pros and cons of running JavaScript in browsers (client, side) or Node.js (server, side), going over the environments, differences, and deciding the right time for each. Also shows simple methods to execute code in both scenarios.

4. Building your toolbox [4 of 51]

This video will help you install the necessary tools for development such as a code editor (VS Code), the Node.js application, and terminal basics to write and execute JavaScript. The video also focuses on making a smooth beginner workflow.

5. Demo: Build your toolbox [5 of 51]
A step, by, step walkthrough is provided to the viewers by the instructor demonstrating how to install Node.js, set up VS Code, create the first JS file, and run it through the terminal. The previous episode's practical setup is being reinforced here.

6. Creating your first application [6 of 51]

Writing and running a simple "Hello World" JavaScript program is explained, covering the basics of file creation and execution in Node.js. The first runnable code helps to build the learner's trust and confidence.

7. Comments [7 of 51]

Explains the use of single, line (//) and multi, line (/* */) comments in JavaScript for code documentation and debugging purposes. Also, it points out some good coding habits and readability for maintainability.

8. Demo: Comments [8 of 51]

This demo demonstrates the addition of different types of comments to a code and also shows how they are ignored when the code is run but still help in understanding the code. It includes practical examples in a script.

9. Declaring variables [9 of 51]

This topic discusses how to declare variables with var, let and const, it also touches upon the differences in scope and introduces some best practices (prefer let/const). Also talks about the variable naming conventions and assigning values.

10. Demo: Declaring variables [10 of 51]

This demonstration illustrates how to declare and use variables practically with different keywords, points out the scope behavior and common mistakes.

11. Working with strings[11 of 51]

This chapter covers string creation, concatenation, character length, and basic methods such as toUpperCase/toLowerCase/indexOf. Besides, it talks about the nature of strings as immutable primitives.

12. Demo: Working with strings [12 of 51]

This is coding demonstration of performing string manipulation operations by including the combining of strings and also the use of common methods.

13. Using template literals to format strings[13 of 51]

It is a new feature of template literals (backticks) of ES6, which make string interpolation with ${expressions} and multi, line strings easier. It also shows a comparison of the benefits of the template literals over the traditional string concatenation.

14. Demo: Using template literals to format strings [14 of 51]
 Illustrates through code examples the use of template literals for creating dynamic strings, embedding variables, and producing formatted output.

15. Data types in JavaScript [15 of 51]

Gives a brief of primitive types (string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, bigint) and the objects, as well as the nature of dynamic typing.

16. Demo: Data types in JavaScript [16 of 51]

Using different data types, declaring and checking them are shown by the use of type of along with performing very basic operations.

17. Math in JavaScript [17 of 51]

This tutorial covers arithmetic operators, the Math object methods like round, floor, ceil, random, etc., and operator precedence. It also discusses number precision issues.

18. Demo: Math in JavaScript [18 of 51]

It demonstrates practical math calculations, random number generation, and working with Math functions.

19. Converting strings to numbers [19 of 51]

It discusses turning strings into numbers with parseInt/parseFloat, Number(), unary +, and dealing with NaN/invalid inputs.

20. Demo: Converting strings to numbers [20 of 51] Shows different ways of converting and how to handle the convert edge cases in the code.
    
21.  Handling errors with try/catch/finally [21 of 51] Explains the error handling syntax: try, catch, finally, and throw to create your own errors. Also looks at the most common errors.
22.  Demo: Handling errors with try/catch/finally [22 of 51] Illustrates how to surround code that might throw an exception with try/catch and use finally for cleanup.
23. Dates [23 of 51] Goes into the Date object in detail, covering creating dates, getting/setting parts, and date formatting. Issues such as months being zero, based are brought up.

24. Demo: Dates [24 of 51] Shows various ways to make, change, and show dates.

25. Boolean logic with if statements [25 of 51] Explains the nature of boolean values, usage of comparison and logical operators (&&, ||, !), and chaining of if/else/if, else constructs to make decisions.
